# Schuko

Showoff-style Markdown->HTML presentation software, in
Clojure(script).  It generates a static HTML file which you can host
anywhere, and uses client-side Javascript and CSS for navigation and
page flipping transitions.

The name is from Wikipedia-assisted word association starting with "Powerpoint": 
> "Schuko" /ˈʃuːkoʊ/ is the colloquial name for a system of AC power plugs and sockets that is defined as "CEE 7/4".

Early days yet: prepare to be unimpressed.

## Usage

```
$ lein deps
$ lein compile
$ lein uberjar
$ java -jar target/schuko-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar input.md output.html
```

where, as you may guess from the names, the first argument is a
Markdown-formatted input file and the second is the HTML file you want
it to generate.  Each top-level heading in the Markdown introduces a
new slide.  

The output file will have all the necessary JS and CSS embedded within
it.  Open it in a web browser.  In Unix tradition, the `Space` bar
will go to the next slide and the `Backspace` key will take you to the
previous slide

## TODO

* CLJS cleanup - it's currently very imperative
* more transition effects
* some syntax in the input file for choosing the transition effect
* user-specified styles
* less ugly default styles
* test on some different browsers
